**So you wanted to build a JVM**

_as in why not???_

actually:
`System.out.println("Hello World")` would be a major achievement. It's slowly getting there...

**so far**
* starts a main class (TODO cmdline args)
* loads classes from a classpath, including jar/jmod files
* instantiates classes
* runs bytecode (TODO more opcodes)
* native methods (not dynamic)

**more TODO's**
* stacktraces
* check visibility
* IO
* garbage collection
* make code nicer, better

**Ultimate goal** 
* Hello world domination
